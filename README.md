# odin-recipes
This project is a recipe website, my first project in The Odin Project. 
It is solely based on HTML, I will be using what I learned throughout the course, which is: lists, images and links. 
I will also use Git commits, which is new to me. I added some CSS to the website, as instructed in the course.
