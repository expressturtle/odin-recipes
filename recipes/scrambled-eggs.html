        Ingredients
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            4 large eggs 
        </li>
        <li>
            1 pinch salt 
        </li>
        <li>
            4 teaspoons butter
        </li>   
    </ul>

    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> 
                Whisk eggs with salt until completely combined and very foamy.   
            </li>
            <li> 
                Melt butter in a skillet over low heat until bubbling. 
                Add whisked eggs; cook, stirring frequently for even, moist curds, until thickened and creamy, but still shiny, 2 to 3 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                Remove scrambled eggs from the pan before they begin to look dry, as they will continue to thicken off the heat. 
            </li>
        </ol>
